# puppet-module-cutover

The purpose of this module is to support cutover upgrades of
puppet open source and Puppet Enterprise by finding and
uninstalling any version of puppet currently installed then
installing the all in one agent.  Currently there is support
for Puppet Enterprise >= 2.0.0 and puppet open source >= 3.0.0
for *nix based agents.  However this will soon be expanded to
include Windows platforms.
