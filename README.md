# puppet-module-cutover

The purpose of this module is to support cutover upgrades of
puppet open source and Puppet Enterprise by finding and
uninstalling any version of puppet currently installed then
installing the all in one agent.  Currently there is only
support for Puppet Enterprise, however that will soon be
expanded to included open source and cutovers which cross
between open source and enterprise.
